This is the project built during the [Udacity's React course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) **React Native** section.

**NOTE 1**: It is *NOT* the final assessment for the course, the only purpose of this project is to put into pratice the course concepts.

**NOTE 2**: It's been bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app): check the original [README.md](docs/CRNA_README.md) for more info about how to start the project.
