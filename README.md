# UdaciFitness Project

This is the project built during the [Udacity's React course](https://www.udacity.com/course/react-nanodegree--nd019) **React Native** section (*it is NOT the final assessment*).

It's been bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app): check the original [README.md](docs/CRNA_README.md) for more info about how to start the project.



**NOTE**: still work in progress, I am updating this as I progress through the course.
